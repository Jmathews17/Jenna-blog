Ah, yes. Sugar. Your body runs on sugar! (Or rather, glucose.) You probably associate it with baked goods, candy, and at some point-hyperactivity. 

There have been so many jokes over the decades about kids going bonkers due to the so-called "sugar rush," and I remember an incident in my 1st grade class where we had an activity learning how to make our own ice cream. One classmate (who ought to be noted for attention-seeking tendencies) suddenly begins shaking in her chair, and says "sugar makes me vibrate!" 

But... does sugar *actually* result in such hyperactivity? What's going on here?

During my time studying nutrition at my university, I learned that on the contrary, sugar induces drowsiness! As you can imagine, my fellow students and I across the lecture hall were flabbergasted. 

Here's the science, simplified:

* Consuming sugar of course increases your carbohydrate intake
* This in turn increases your blood glucose
* Glucose in the blood stimulates the pancreas to release insulin (a hormone that enables you to metabolize the carbs & produce glucose)
* Insulin then triggers the uptake of glucose by the body's cells
* The brain then releases tryptophan, an amino acid that serves as a building block for serotonin
* The brain releases serotonin, known as the calming neurotransmitter
* Ultimately, serotonin provides us with feelings of satiety, lethargy, & drowsiness! This explains why perhaps after eating a meal of starchy pasta, you feel calm, and cool.

   However, the consumption of simple sugars, such as sucrose (AKA table sugar) is more complex. Consuming simple sugars on an empty stomach results in those sugars being absorbed rapidly, triggering a sharp increase in insulin production (a hormone required for carbohydrate digestion, as noted previously.) The resulting condition is called *hypoglycemia,* which can make you feel temporarily jumpy, as opposed to calm. Consuming simple sugars on a more filled stomach renders the absorption process much slower, and thus may induce that calming effect that is associated with the more complex carbohydrates.

  Some food for thought!

\**Remember, glucose is vital to proper functioning of the body. Unless there are extenuating medical situations that preclude consumption of a specific food/food group, all foods should be enjoyed in moderation, and are not to be moralized as "good" or "bad."*

This information came straight from my professor, (and whatever textbook I was using at the time) but here are some other references on sugar & general metabolism:
