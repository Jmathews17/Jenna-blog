Following our trend of random conversations and musings, my sister's family and I somehow got on the topic of debating which is "the best" bean. My brother-in-law was a staunch supporter of green beans, but I opted for the more versatile and pervasive soybean.

But then of course came the question...what is a bean?

The story of beans go back to Fabaceae (or Leguminosae) family, the 3rd largest of flowering plants. In colloquial terms, "beans" and "legumes" are often used interchangeably, but they actually have distinct meanings.

**Legume** = Plants that bear fruit that are specifically grown in pods

**Pulse** = A broader term for the edible seed from the legume plant; peas, lentils, and beans are types of pulses

(For example, the pea pod is a legume, but the pea inside the pod is a pulse)

Basically, all beans are legumes, but not all legumes are beans! Here are some common legumes that we mistakenly believe to be beans: asparagus beans, peanuts, soybeans, green beans, black-eyed peas, sugar snap peas, etc. (However, while peanuts are a legume, for culinary purposes they are used just like nuts)

While we may never resolve our question of the most superior of beans, we may now be on the right track to discovering "the best" of the legumes.
