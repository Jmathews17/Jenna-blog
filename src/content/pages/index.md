Currently a student at Brigham Young University, my chronic curiosity and love of learning has led me down an exciting and varied path of education.\
I am eager to leverage the skills I'm continuing to develop at BYU with my enthusiasm for learning to reveal deep relationships between the various sciences, humanities, and international studies with a geographic approach. I thrive on simplicity and accessibility, and am committed to creating work that conveys complex information in engaging, understandable ways with the ultimate goal of informing decisions, educating others, and producing results.
