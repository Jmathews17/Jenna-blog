Hi!

I'm Jenna, a university student who is easily fascinated and chronically curious. 

Thus, it was an agonizing process to figure out what I wanted to do with my life; everything piqued my interest! I'd considered nearly a dozen wildly varying majors, and have already switched it twice, but I think I've finally settled. Besides, one's future career doesn't necessarily bear any loyalty to one's college degree! 

Even so, it was a tragic day indeed to declare a single course of study, feeling like I had to leave behind all my other passions...

But I decided I didn't want to live a life of grueling academia only to work an unfulfilling job the rest of my life. I have long struggled with life under the suffocating cloud of depression-and I still do-but I want life to be an adventure! 

I want to fall in love with life again, and I realized that part of that love is in the fascination I have about so much of the world.
